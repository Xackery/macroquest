|# This is a script that can be used on a tank. It's basically.. attack anything within a radius of tank.
|# To stop it from attacking, tap F1 (target self). This is some times needed since untargettables will be spam-targetted if nearby even on fail.
|# It doesn't auto move, but does track your cash earnings.
